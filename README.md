## Running the code
To run the code, first make sure all dependencies are installed. You will need:
1. a newer version of python
2. the openai api, and 
3. flask<br>

From here, open a terminal, navigate to the QHacks2023 folder, and enter the command "py - m flask run"

## Using the app
Once you've ran the command above, the app should open in your default web browser. Now, provide it with the three requested pieces of information:
1. Your best app/product idea
2. Your idea for a matching logo
3. Your desired pitch length<br>

and hit run. After a few seconds of the ai working its magic, you'll be presented with a full slide deck for your idea, and a complete script to pitch it.
<br>
Lastly, try as many prompts as you can
