## Running the code
To run the code, first get the code from GitHub and then make sure all dependencies are installed. You will need installed:
1. a newer version of python
2. the openai api, and 
3. flask<br>

If you're not sure how to install or if you have everything installed yet don't worry, when you try and run the code it will let you know what you're missing and how to get it.

Next, open the app.py file in a python or text editor and in line 5 where it says "your-api-key-here", replace it with your openai api key. If you don't have one, you can get one for free at https://beta.openai.com/signup/ 

From here, open a terminal(mac)/command prompt(windows), navigate to the QHacks2023 folder, and enter the command "py -m flask run" or "python -m flask run" for windows or "python3 -m flask run" for mac. The terminal will tell you something to the effect of "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/"

## Using the app
You can then take this link and paste it into the Google Chrome search bar (Safari sometimes acts funny). Now, provide it with the three requested pieces of information:
1. Your best app/product idea
2. Your idea for a matching logo
3. Your desired pitch length<br>

and hit run. After a few seconds of the ai working its magic, you'll be presented with a full slide deck for your idea, and a complete script to pitch it.
<br>
Lastly, try again with as many prompts as you can
